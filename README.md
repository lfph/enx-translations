# Exposure Notification Express Translations

These translations were done by Washington State for their ENX deployment, and they have graciously agreed to contribute these to the LFPH community. Please feel free to take these and adopt them for your own app. One thing we are working on as a community is making them generic - highlighting where a state should enter in their state name and replace the URL. We are doing this by inserting [State Name], [State Abbreviation], [State Department of Health], [App Name], [URL], and [Phone] where it makes sense. Please help contribute to this and pay it forward by taking a translation or two and making the appropriate substitutions so that those who want to use these in the future can have an easier time of it. The best way to do so is to make those corrections in “suggestion” mode. The English translation has had this done already so you may see what this should look like. 

In addition, if there is something where you feel that there might be a better way of phrasing something, please do suggest it, no matter the language. 

We hope that other states can contribute additional languages to this document so that accessibility of the Exposure Notification Express technology continues to grow.

For the moment, these translations are available via a Google document. Please request access to this document using a .gov email address, as at the moment we are granting priority access to public health authorities. Please use the "comment" mode to submit changes and updates.
